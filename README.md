# Flappy-Bird
 This project is a Flappy Bird game developed in Python using Pygame, with AI implemented through the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) library. The game features pixel-perfect collision detection using Pygame masks and includes rotation for a more realistic bird movement. The neural network was trained with different inputs, experimenting with configurations to optimize performance. The code is documented on GitHub, demonstrating how NEAT evolves the AI's ability to play the game.
